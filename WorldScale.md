A "cell" on the Carnivores world map is 256x256 units (256 scales to 1 meter) which means that Carnivores 1 maps are approximately capable of 512 ^2 square meters of worldspace on a horizontal plane.

In Carnivores, a cell can contain a single object origin (but many objects may overlap in that space)
